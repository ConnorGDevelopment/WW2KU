WTFAILA - What the fuck am I looking at?
In my comments, I'll leave these in places where I do or use some non-intuitive/advanced/complex shit
I'll do my best to describe how and why I am doing that thing
I hope it is helpful, worst-case scenario is it shaves some time off your google searching
In general, I try to avoid doing stuff like this unless its for a good reason

A good rule of thumb though is to always code like you'll have to hand it to someone else, even on solo projects.
Because it is essential to always remember this sacred programming proverb: 
"When the code was written, only god and I knew how it worked. In 6 months, it will be god alone"
