## Assignment Breakdown for Academic Clarity

### Work Completed in ECT 2401 by Rev Guarino, Noah Kimes, Dylan O'Donnell

Our assignment in ECT 2401 was to create a prototype showing inital functionality of a Game Concept we had developed as a group.
The actual deliverables were:

1. Game Design Document
2. Level Design Document
3. Prototype

Note: Making the game in Unity was not actually a required part of this assignment, I'm a programmer so that was the tool I chose to mock things up and it went from there. (Rev)

### Work Completed in ECT 2210 by Rev Guarino, David Oyuke

1. Changed Control System from a pile of MonoBehaviors to using an Orchestrator + UnityEvents to manage GameActions (Rev)
2. The Target Selection system was changed from using OnClick events to Camera Raycasters (Rev)
3. A custom shader was created to indicate the selected unit (David/Rev)
4. The UI Design was overhauled from the Proof of Concept stage (David/Rev)
5. Audio was added to the Main Game Stage to provide input feedback (David)
